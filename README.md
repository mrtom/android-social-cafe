Author: Vikas Gupta (www.facebook.com/vg)

## Installing

1. If you can't wait to try out the Social Cafe, the SocialCafe.apk is included in the root folder. Install it on your handset or emulator. Note that Single Sign On requires the Facebook app which can either be installed from the Google Play store (latest version) or using the Facebook.apk (old version) provided in the Facebook SDK.

1. Building and installing the samples requires you to add the Facebook SDK. Follow instructions at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/android/build/

1. Open Eclipse and create 'Android Project from Existing Code'. Use fbsamples/android-social-cafe folder as the Rood Directory

1. Link the Facebook SDK as Library in the Android settings of the Project Properties. Remove the existing Facebook Library if any as it likely be failing depending on your Facebook SDK location.

1. Note that the Single Sign On would not work using the pre-defined APP_ID in the SocialCafeApplication.java. This is because SSO requires defining the keyhash for your debug keystore in the app settings. You can however, create or use an existing app and define the og actions and objects as described below. If you are not familiar with the Open Graph concepts or would like a refresher, please read https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/
